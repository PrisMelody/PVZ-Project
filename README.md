# PVZ-Project

Basic demo! Click on a seed packet in order to select the plant that will appear.
Zombies will walk in from the left side of the screen, and there's nothing you can do about it! (Luckily, we haven't implemented death)

This version does not have all of the plants we plan to include, and the zombie sprites aren't properly animated.
Additionally, it doesn't include some of our controller classes, since we didn't have time to get those working properly.
